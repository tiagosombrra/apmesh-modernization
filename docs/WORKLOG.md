# Modernization work log

This ledger summarizes integrated engineering deliveries; detailed commands,
failures, hashes and limitations stay in the linked evidence records.

| Delivery | Integrated record | Result and continuity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stage 0 | PR #1; PROVENANCE.md and evidence/BOOTSTRAP_VALIDATION.md | Separate immutable publication import, local quality infrastructure and plan |
| Stage 1 | PR #3 and closure #4; evidence/STAGE1_CLOSURE.md | Independent regression, explicit orientation/corner/order/CSV repairs; exact qualified reference |
| Stage 2 | PR #6 and closure #7; evidence/STAGE2_CLOSURE.md | Complete production inventory, ownership/domain contracts, ADR and repair sequence; no production delta |
| 2026-10-16, stage 3 slice 1 | #8, PR #9; head 6c6c2f2d50f5870fd92e4edbc91fc5d901a1cd22, main e30fa99a8ea6da709f3943e8975efb31d9610b1d | Reproduced and repaired SetNoh foreign-adjacency UAF; CTest 10/10, 74 Python controls, ASan/CRT 7/7, exact Eistute/Book head/main regression |

| 2026-10-17, stage 3 slice 4 | #17, PR #18; head ef89fd9d3305a9ed4c88548df086540d00bbadd3, main da3eed2dc351cfe1a82b117d686164686c738d95; evidence/STAGE3_UV_REGISTRATION_CLOSURE.md | Pending Boundary/template registration and Face::quality unwind repaired; missing-quadtree queries throw; 784-blob tree; head/main CTest 14/14, UV 49/49, node 7/7, 1,361 allocation failures, exact article/UV traces |

Current status: stages 0-2 closed; stage 3 in progress with four qualified
slices; stages 4-11 pending.

The wider stage 3 remains open with four qualified slices. Next qualify
earlier tree generation/subdivision, remaining mutation/helper and curve
internal scopes, then sample/initialization/rollback ownership. Other template
patterns, full-process and parallel/LSan/UBSan scope remain open.

No full-application memory-safety claim is made.

[Current state](PROJECT_STATE.md), [plan](MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md),
[slice 4 closure](evidence/STAGE3_UV_REGISTRATION_CLOSURE.md).
