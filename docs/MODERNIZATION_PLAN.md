# Technique-preserving modernization plan

Source and immutable import: see PROVENANCE.md. This repository is the working
authority; PROJECT_STATE.md records the current work item and verified results.

Current status: stage 0 integrated in PR #1; stage 1 candidate implementation
and tests are available in a draft delivery tracked by issue #2. Strict Eistute
numerical comparison fails in the unchanged baseline as well as before/after
the candidate. Keep the gate failing; do not infer numerical equivalence solely
from identical six-significant-digit OBJ files. Per-incidence boundary coverage
remains open. Stages 2–11 have not started.

## Non-negotiable boundary

Preserve parametric patches, shared-curve synchronization, boundary adaptation
passes, quadtree/templates, advancing-front reconstruction, curvature-error
definitions, and acceptance/stopping policy. Record defect repairs that change
results separately. QUAD, anisotropy and replacement algorithms require an
explicit scientific proposal and advisor agreement after software stabilization.

## Deliveries and gates

| Stage | Scope | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Separate private repository; immutable import, provenance, audit and local quality commands | Exact source-tree import; build; tooling tests; published plan and limitations |
| 1 | Trustworthy regression and errors | Missing/empty/invalid input fails; candidate/rejected/accepted states distinguished; independent negative controls; zero coverage rejected |
| 2 | Mesh and architecture inventory | Map CRABMesh and physical/parametric mesh concepts, ownership, identity, conversions, duplicate computations and dependencies |
| 3 | Memory and lifecycle repairs | Construction/replacement/rejection/restoration/failure/repeated runs; qualified ASan/LSan/UBSan or justified equivalent; deliberate positive/negative controls |
| 4 | Portable modern C++ and build | Remove VLAs/extensions; qualify GCC/Clang/MSVC; review initialization/conversions; C++23 target qualified against C++17 reference; sanitizers enabled |
| 5 | Replace Eigen's actual subset | Fixed-size standard-library math; analytic, aliasing and differential tests; point/derivative/curvature/mesh/acceptance regressions; remove vendored Eigen afterward |
| 6 | Integrate CRABMesh responsibilities | Library plus thin CLI, explicit context, reduced globals; consolidate genuine duplication; preserve 2D/3D mapping and algorithm sequence |
| 7 | English identifiers and interfaces | Classes/functions/variables/files/comments/messages translated in batches; terminology map; versioned compatibility for configs/reports/CLI |
| 8 | Doxygen and architecture documentation | Ownership, domains, units, orientation, failures and article correspondence documented; generated pages reviewed; warnings resolved |
| 9 | Measured efficiency | Correct clocks, repeated comparable profiling; prove improvements without reduced coverage or changed criteria |
| 10 | Integrated qualification | Same revision passes memory, regression, portability, documentation, negative inputs and supported serial/OpenMP coverage; MPI separately qualified |
| 11 | Freeze modernized baseline | Identified reproducible release with inputs, commands, toolchain, outcomes, limitations and advisor-ready engineering/scientific change ledger |

English, tests and contracts accompany each touched component; stages 7 and 8
are comprehensive closure reviews. Stages 3/4 may alternate to unblock memory
tools, with one active work item at a time. No broad rewrite before stage 2.

## Test program

- Analytic geometry: curves, patches, derivatives, area, normal and curvature.
- Fixed-size linear algebra: dimensions, multiplication, transposition, aliasing,
  singular/degenerate cases and numerically difficult examples.
- Ownership/connectivity: valid indices, identity, orientation, observer lifetime,
  adjacencies and invalidation of derived caches.
- Shared boundaries: every incidence, reversed orientation and non-manifold
  junctions; a zero-comparison report is unmeasured, never a positive result.
- Adaptation: accepted/rejected candidates, rollback, retry and stopping traces.
- Inputs/outputs: absent, empty, malformed, invalid configuration, unwritable
  output; no success with an empty mesh caused by a failed input.
- Independent mesh checks and intentionally corrupt fixtures to test checkers.
- Memory: leak controls, undefined behavior, repeated rebuilding and peak memory.
- Determinism: repetitions and serial/OpenMP under explicit comparison budgets.

Do not replace scientific regression with golden byte counts alone. Separate
archived publication artifacts from executable accepted-state outcomes. Store
failed cases, not only successes. Large campaigns stay local; retain compact
reports and hashes in Git.

## Architecture and dependency direction

Inventory before abstraction: geometry and numerical primitives; topology and
mesh ownership; boundary adaptation; existing CRABMesh interior generation;
adaptive orchestration; independent evaluation and IO; thin CLI. Dependencies
must point toward stable geometry/data contracts. Geometry must not perform
process-level IO. Avoid a universal mesh class or gratuitous interface layers.

The target is no mandatory third-party production dependency for serial runs.
Compiler, CMake, Python test tooling, Doxygen and analyzers remain development
tools. MPI/OpenMP are optional and reported separately. Preserve license and
authorship records when integrating components.

## Automation rollout

Use EditorConfig, explicit whitespace repair, clang-format, selective clang-tidy,
CTest, compilation databases, local sanitizer campaigns and Doxygen. Enforce
rules on changed code in reviewed batches; inventory legacy debt without hiding
it behind disabled checks. Never auto-apply semantic modernization fixes.
No paid Actions, hosted workflows or dependency auto-updaters are configured.
